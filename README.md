## Introduction

>The 2018 NCA F2F Qualifier is an event hosted by Cyber Security Challenge (CSC) UK. CSC hosts various CTF events sponsored by companies
with a variety of skill levels. For the 2018 NCA F2F event, we see a forensics-based theme which contains the analysis of a suspect's
hardware, and the retrieval of open source information (OSI). The qualifier is a typical CSC-style quiz, whereby participants have to
select the correct choice based off the information gathering stage.

## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of computer forensics is required, and the familiarity of related forensic tools are needed to extract information.
